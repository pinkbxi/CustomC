# CustomC
An Attempt To Improve C# Console


Everything is well documented in the code but I'll try to make this an documentation

Every funcion does not need color input

# CustomC.Print(string Input, ConsoleColor."your sellected color");
    it basically works like normal Console.WriteLine() just that you can add colors easier
    
# CustomC.Mask(string Input, ConsoleColor."your sellected color");
    It just masks the given string

# CustomC.Reversed(string Input, ConsoleColor."your sellected color");
    Reverses given string
    
# CustomC.Wait();
    Waits until button is pressed
