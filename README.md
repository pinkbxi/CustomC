# CustomC
An Attempt To Improve C# Console


Everything is well documented in the code but I'll try to make this an documentation

Every funcion does not require color input it is optinal

# CustomC.Print(string Input, ConsoleColor."your selected color");
    This funcion prints given text to the console
    
# CustomC.Mask(string Input, ConsoleColor."your selected color");
    This funcion encrypts given text and prints hash code of your string to the console

# CustomC.Reversed(string Input, ConsoleColor."your selected color");
    This funcion reverses the given string and prints it
    
# CustomC.Wait();
    This funcion waits until button is pressed can be used in the end of your code to not let
    console close before wanted
